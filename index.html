                <h3>Coder</h3>
                <p>I first played around with programming in 2015, but didn’t get really into it until I started studying for my bachelor’s degree at Linnaeus University in 2018. The university’s curriculum had us learn Java, but I’ve also learned C# and TypeScript/JavaScript on the side. At this point I have the most experience in C#, mainly building Web APIs in ASP.NET Core. I’m currently working on bettering my web development skills in order to become a full-stack developer (though I’m much more  comfortable with backend at the moment). Looking also to expand my Java knowledge by diving into the Spring Framework soon. You can see a couple projects I’ve worked on below in the <a href="#experience">experience</a> section.</p>

                <h3>Reader</h3>
                <p>I’ve always liked reading, but now I am a true avid reader. Growing up my reading was all fiction books, but now I’m trying to read just about any semi-interesting non-fiction book I can get my hands on. I got inspired to start reading and broadening my mind more from Bill Gates and his blog <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books" target="_blank">GatesNotes</a>. He is reading constantly, and seeing how he is one of the smartest people on the planet, maybe we should all be reading constantly too. You’ll often find me reading one of the books he’s recommended on that blog.</p>

            <div class="musician">
                <h3>Musician</h3>
                <p>I started playing guitar in around 7th grade and picked up the drums and piano some years later. My dad plays guitar and my mom plays the piano so I always had help. Nowadays I also make music electronically on the computer. My DAW (digital audio workstation) is FL Studio, which I’ve been messing around with to make music for nearly ten years now. I enjoy it, but am still no master with it yet. I’ve made and released a few songs to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/7jb4gv8tqlAGjHaZo6xE5E?si=sMx-z8JlQlGDyyxl-qALlg" target="_blank">Spotify</a> and other platforms. I can hear some things I’d change about them now, but I'm hoping that means I’m learning more and will continue to get better. I plan to keep making music casually and releasing songs whenever I have the time.</p>

            <div class="story">
                <p>I graduated high school in 2013 from a relatively small town in Ohio, and since then I’ve been trying to push my boundaries and explore. I travelled to Costa Rica in 2015 alone, my first time outside of the US. Then in 2016 I volunteered for the organization <a href="https://www.allhandsandhearts.org/" target="_blank">All Hands and Hearts</a>, helping clean-up and rebuild in Louisiana and later in Ecuador, each of which had suffered from natural disasters. Finally, I moved to Sweden in 2018 to live with my girlfriend (whom I met on that Costa Rica trip) and pursue a bachelor’s degree in Software Technology at Linnaeus University in Växjö. The fluffball in the picture is our beloved dog, Luna.</p>

                            This <span class="font-bold">Spending Tracker</span> web app is a simple app that lets users enter their expenses, categorize them, and see how much they're spending from month to month or year to year. This is a live application that anyone is welcome to use, available <a href="https://spendingtracker.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here</a>. It is still very much in beta, and uses free-tier hosting services, so the site can be slow at times. I plan to continuously update the site, and include features such as adding the ability to change currency.

                            I made this to use personally but also to learn how to host an application online (this is the first full project I've ever hosted). It was made with <span class="font-bold">HTML</span>, <span class="font-bold">CSS</span>, and <span class="font-bold">Vanilla JavaScript</span> for the frontend and an <span class="font-bold">ASP.NET Core</span> backend.

                            <span class="font-bold">KeepSuite</span> is a web app for tracking what books you've read and what you thought about them. Users can enter when they read the book, a summary and review of it, as well as select an overall reaction to it from a list of options. Users can also do the same things with movies, television shows, and documentaries.

                            My girlfriend, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/louisejakobsson/" target="_blank">Louise Jakobsson</a>, and I made this project together, with a focus on making a very smooth, satisfying, and user-friendly experience (many websites have the opposite experience). For the frontend we opted for <span class="font-bold">Vue</span> and tried out a backend framework called <span class="font-bold">NestJS</span>, a framework built on top of Node.js which uses <span class="font-bold">TypeScript</span>.

                            I was extremely lucky to have the chance to work on a real project during my studies. <a href="https://www.happyatwork.io/en-us/" target="_blank">Happy at Work</a> is a startup whose software service tracks employee feedback anonymously. There I worked primarily on the backend of the service, which was an <span class="font-bold">ASP.NET</span> project.

                        <p>
                            Beyond that, I learned other critical processes which are extremely important when working on a project in a team, like using <span class="font-bold">Git</span> in an environment where there are several developers, agile processes like <span class="font-bold">scrum</span> and <span class="font-bold">kanban</span> (we tried both while I was there), <span class="font-bold">continous integration</span>, and the flow of using <span class="font-bold">Dev</span>, <span class="font-bold">Test</span>, and <span class="font-bold">Production</span> environments.
